# Udemy: Learn Clojure, a fun new functional programming language

These are my notes for [Clojure: The Complete Beginner's
Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/clojureprogramming/) created by [Catalin
Stefan](https://www.udemy.com/user/catalinstefan2/).

The course material can be found on GitHub at
[github.com/CatalinStefan/Clojure](https://github.com/CatalinStefan/Clojure)

## Getting Started

This project uses [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) as the build tool. To run
the REPL, use `lein repl` in the terminal. To run the tests, use `lein test`. To
run the main function, use `lein run -m tutorial.core`.

## Calva

UseVSCode with the
[Calva extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=betterthantomorrow.calva)
is recommended for Clojure development. It provides features like REPL
integration, code evaluation, and debugging.
